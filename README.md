# Flutter Random Fun Demo Project

This is a simple Flutter project that demonstrates the use of the following widgets:
- `Text`
- `ElevatedButton`
- `Container`
- `Column`
- `Row`
- `Image`
- `ListView`
- `GridView`
- `Card`

## Reason Behind This Project

I created this project to demonstrate the use of the above-mentioned widgets in a simple and fun way. This project is also a part of my Flutter learning journey.
I discovered that the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else. So, I decided to create this project and share it with the community.
