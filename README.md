- `ListView`
- `GridView`
- `Card`

## Features

## Reason Behind This Project

I created this project to demonstrate the use of the above-mentioned widgets in a simple and fun way. This project is also a part of my Flutter learning journey.
I discovered that the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else. So, I decided to create this project and share it with the community.

## How to Run
Use Command:
```
flutter run
```
in the terminal after installing flutter sdk
